# PV Sizing & ROI Calculator - Open Source Community Project

[![Contributions Welcome] (CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Welcome to the PV Sizing & ROI Calculator project!** ðŸ‘‹

This is an open-source application designed to help users estimate the optimal size for their photovoltaic (PV) solar panel system and calculate the potential Return on Investment (ROI) in Malaysia.  We believe in the power of community collaboration and are excited to have you join us in making this tool even better!

## What is this App?

This application aims to simplify the process of Solar Panel and Battery Sizing with ROI analysis .  It's designed to be user-friendly and provide valuable insights into:

* **PV System Sizing:**  Estimate the ideal size of a solar panel system based on factors like Panel Wattage, , and desired energy offset.
* **Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation:**  Project the financial benefits of a solar investment, considering factors like installation costs, energy savings, bille after government incentives, and electricity prices.
* **Scenario Analysis:**  Allow users to experiment with different parameters (e.g., panel types, electricity tariffs, financing options) to understand their impact on system performance and ROI.

**Key Features (Current):**

* **Input Parameters:**
    * Solar Panel Power & No. of Solar Panel
    * Solar panel specifications (efficiency, cost)
    * Monthly Bill
    * Overall Costing
* **Output Metrics: (in technical terms)**
    * Recommended PV system size (kW)
    * Estimated annual energy production (kWh)
    * Tariff cost breakdown
    * Monthly electricity savings
    * Payback period 
    
We believe that open-source development fosters innovation, transparency, and creates tools that truly serve the community. By making this project open source, we aim to:

* **Harness Collective Wisdom:**  Benefit from the diverse knowledge and expertise of developers, solar energy enthusiasts, and users worldwide.
* **Promote Transparency:**  Ensure the calculations and underlying logic are open for scrutiny and improvement.
* **Create a Better Tool for Everyone:**  Build a more accurate estimation, and give convenience to regular users who are planning to adopt solar energy.
* **Learn and Grow Together:**  Provide a platform for learning and sharing knowledge about PV systems and renewable energy.
