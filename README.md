# PV Sizing & ROI Calculator - Open Source Community Project

[![Contributors are Welcomed] (CONTRIBUTING.md)

**Welcome to the PV Sizing & ROI Calculator project!** ðŸ‘‹

This is an open-source application designed to help users estimate the optimal size for their photovoltaic (PV) solar panel system and calculate the potential Return on Investment (ROI) in Malaysia.  We believe in the power of community collaboration and are excited to have you join us in making this tool even better!

## What is this App?

This application aims to simplify the process of Solar Panel and Battery Sizing with ROI analysis .  It's designed to be user-friendly and provide valuable insights into:

* **PV System Sizing:**  Estimate the ideal sizing; power output of a solar panel system based on factors like Panel Wattage, , and panel and inverter characteristics.
* **Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation:**  Project the financial benefits of a solar investment, considering factors like installation costs, energy savings, bills after government incentives, and electricity prices.
* **Scenario Analysis:**  Allow users to experiment with different parameters (e.g., panel types, inverter type, electricity tariffs, monthly bill costs) to understand their impact on system performance and ROI.

**Key Features (Current):**

* **Input Parameters:**
    * Solar Panel Power & No. of Solar Panel
    * Solar panel specifications (efficiency, cost)
    * Monthly Bill
    * Overall Costing
* **Output Metrics: (in technical terms)**
    * Recommended PV system size (kW)
    * Estimated daily & monthly energy production (kWh)
    * Tariff cost breakdown
    * Monthly electricity savings
    * Payback period 
    
We believe that open-source development fosters innovation, transparency, and creates tools that truly serve the community. By making this project open source, we aim to:

* **Harness Collective Wisdom:**  Benefit from the diverse knowledge and expertise of developers, solar energy enthusiasts, and users worldwide.
* **Promote Transparency:**  Ensure the calculations and underlying logic are open for scrutiny and improvement.
* **Create a Better Tool for Everyone:**  Build a more accurate estimation, and give convenience to regular users who are planning to adopt solar energy.
* **Learn and Grow Together:**  Provide a platform for learning and sharing knowledge about PV systems and renewable energy.

## Roadmap & Future Enhancements

We have a vision for continuously improving this application.  Some of the planned future enhancements include:

* **Web-based Deployment:**  Making the application accessible online for wider usage.
* **Interactive Visualizations:**  Adding charts and graphs to visualize results and make them more insightful.
* **Advanced Scenario Modeling:**  Including more sophisticated factors like shading, panel orientation optimization, and battery storage integration.
* **Integration with Data APIs:**  Connecting to external APIs for real-time weather data, panel specifications, and electricity tariffs.
* **Mobile Responsiveness:**  Ensuring the application works well on different screen sizes, including Apple devices.
* **User Accounts & Saved Projects:**  Allowing users to save their projects and track their solar planning progress.

This roadmap is flexible and will be shaped by community feedback and contributions.


**In short, the app is free to use, but for current situation do not to modify, and distribute this software for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, as the original copyright and license notice is still in process.**
